Whitespace (0x20) is a hackerspace in the wonderful city of Ghent, Belgium. It is a physical space run by a group of people dedicated to various aspects of constructive & creative hacking. Our FAQ is an ever growing useful resource of information about who we are, what we do and how you can become a part of all the awesomeness. Also check out the hackerspaces in Antwerp, Brussels and Charleroi.
You're always welcome to attend one of the workshops or join the weekly Thursday meetings, the hack nights or the other awesome get-together events
