Whitespace (0x20) is a hackerspace in the wonderful city of Ghent, Belgium. It is a physical space run by a group of people dedicated to various aspects of constructive & creative hacking. Our FAQ is an ever growing useful resource of information about who we are, what we do and how you can become a part of all the awesomeness. Also check out the hackerspaces in Antwerp, Brussels and Charleroi.
