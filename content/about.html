This site aims to provide alist of hacker/maker/.../spaces in Belgium.

If you want to add your space fork the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/0x20/hackerspaces.be) and send me a pull request.

The Fork & Pull Model lets anyone fork an existing repository and push changes to their personal fork without requiring access be granted to the source repository. The changes must then be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer. This model reduces the amount of friction for new contributors and is popular with open source projects because it allows people to work independently without upfront coordination.

You can find more info on the [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
